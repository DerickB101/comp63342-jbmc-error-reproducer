# JBMC Counterexample Simplifier

This project was developed for Topic 4.6 of the COMP63342 Software Security Seminar (University of Manchester, 2024–25). It aims to improve the usability of counterexamples generated by the Java Bounded Model Checker (JBMC) by converting them into simplified, runnable Java programs that reproduce assertion failures.

## Project Overview

Bounded Model Checking (BMC) is widely used to verify safety properties in software. When violations are found, tools like JBMC produce detailed counterexample traces. These traces are useful but often difficult to interpret, especially for larger programs. Our tool automates the following:

- Parsing JBMC’s JSON-formatted output
- Extracting meaningful assignments and function calls
- Generating simplified Java code that reproduces the bug

This process helps developers understand and debug assertion failures more easily.

## Repository Structure

- `run.py` – Main script to compile Java code, run JBMC, and process results
- `parse_jbmc.py` – Handles JSON output and manages trace parsing
- `parse_trace.py` – Extracts assignment and function steps from traces
- `java_gen.py` – Generates simplified Java files from parsed counterexamples

## How to Use

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- JBMC

### Run on a single Java file:

```bash
python run.py path/to/File.java --jbmc /path/to/jbmc
